### 27 May 2023: PostgreSQL Study - Day 1
I am to follow three main resources: 

1. [PostgreSQL Tutorial Full Course 2022 by Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85pG_pDkITY&ab_channel=DerekBanas)

2. [PostgreSQL for Everybody by Charles Severance](https://www.pg4e.com/)

3. PostgreSQL courses on Datacamp

Since long, I had to create a course on Databases. It was supposedly a 6 part course. 

1. Database Management Systems (Theory)  
2. Relational Databases (PostgreSQL)
3. Non-relational Databases (MongoDB)
4. Caching Databases (Redis)
5. Distributed Databases (Cassandra)
6. Cloud Databases (AWS database services)

Out of these 6, at least, let's try to cover the first two.

Next day - Sunday, will spend time only learning stuff!
